<h1>The Best Movies According to Angela</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Harry Potter and the Prizoner of Azkaban</h3>
<p>This is my favourite movie. I love how it has a halloween/autumn aesthetic.</p>
<h3>The Nightmare Before Christmas</h3>
<p>My favourite Tim Burton movie. It has the best music, while having mix of christmas-halloween theme.</p>
<h3>Hercules</h3>
<p>Although it doesn't portrait the greek myhtology correctly, I like how the character is somehow feels relatable.</p>
